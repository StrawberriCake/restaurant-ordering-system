# Restaurant Ordering System 🌮🥗🌯
Welcome to Group 2 Cloud Restaurant Ordering System github repo! We are a large food restaurant company that delivers food to hungry peeps! 

To ensure that our customers don't starve, we need to implement extensive systems' health monitoring to ensure our app is up and running 24/7. 🔪🧑‍🍳 We, the awesome SREs are here to the rescue to ensure that systems and application failures are flagged early and logs are provided for our engineers to troubleshoot. 

So let's get things cooking! 🍳

*PS: this is a fictious project and for educational purposes only. We're not a real company 🥲*

## Technologies Used

# Let's start ordering! 🍽️

This is an application running on Vue with a mySQL database based on this [repo](https://github.com/Quanghihicoder/restaurant-ordering-system).

## Local development

- To set up environmental variables in your local environment, rename `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env` and 
`frontend/.env.example` to `backend/.env` with updated variables.
- Refer to the `deployment` folder for instructions in deployment in dockers or AWS EKS kubernetes

## Deploying fluentd to enable pod logging 

1. Create a namespace: ```kubectl create ns amazon-cloudwatch```

2. Create fluentd configmap: ```kubectl apply -f ./monitoring-logging/0-configmap.yaml```

3. Apply fluentd monitoring:```kubectl apply -f ./monitoring-logging/1-fluentd-logging.yaml```

4. Check AWS to ensure logs are flowing into cloudwatch.

## Deploying Grafana for AWS Cloudwatch Monitoring
1. Create a namespace: ```kubectl create ns monitoring```

2. Install grafana using helm: ```helm install grafana grafana/grafana -n monitoring```

3. Port forward application to monitor locally: ```kubectl port-forward svc/grafana 3000:80 -n monitoring```
